===TODO=== Put your name next to each item once you have read it. Feel free to add useful tutorials/guides you feel we should all read.

1.) Read up on the Guava collections. http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/overview-summary.html Especially the Immutable collections. We should use these
because they are thread safe, faster than their corresponding java collections, and take up less memory. Use @VisibleForTesting if you want to test a method that should otherwise be private and give it default visibility.
